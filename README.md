# EOF-SOM-Analysis
This repository contains the implementation of a method that combines Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to analyze the SPMIP data. The SPMIP (Spatial Pattern and Intensity Measures) dataset is widely used in the field of earthquake engineering to understand the spatial patterns of ground motion intensity.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
